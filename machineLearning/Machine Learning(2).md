## How can we solve real world problems with data Science?

### Data science can solve problems you'd expected.

> Netflix uses collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend movies to users based on things they're previously watched.Also,elements of many popular social media websites are powered by data science.Things like recommending new connections on Linkedin,constructing your Facebook news feed or suggesting new people to follow on Twitter.

* Netflix
* Social Media
* Web Apps(OkCupid,Uber,etc)

### And more you might not expect

> Data science concepts are integral in processing and modeling data in the field bioinformatics where scientists are working on projects like annotating genomes and analysing data sequences.

* Bioinformatics
* Urban Planning
* Astrophysics
* Public Health

## Philosophy of Machine Learning

It's  computational applied statistics.It's about this broader nation of building artifacts,computational artifacts,typically.That learn over time based on experience.And then in particular,it's not just the act of building these artifacts that matter.

It's the math behind it.

It's the science behind it.

I'ts the engineering behind it.

It's the computing behind it.

It's everything that goes into building intelligent artifacts that almost by necessity have to learn over time.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning as being the problem of taking labelled data sets,gleaning information from it so that you can label new data sets.

## Induction and Deduction

It's function approximation.It's figuring out how to take a bunch of training examples and coming up with some function that generalizes beyond the data that you see.
