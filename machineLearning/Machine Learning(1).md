# Machine Learning(1)

## machine learning's introduction

* tow category

(1)articial intelligence

(2)data science

> classification and regression

It's about building model of data

## Fundamental Conundrums of Artificial Intelligence

* (1)All intelligent agents have little computational resources,processing speed,memory size.
* (2)All computation is local,but most AI problems have global constraints.How can we get AI agents to address global problems using only local computation?
* (3)Computation logic is fundamentally deductive,but many AI problems adductive or inductive in their nature.How can we get AI agents to address adductive or inductive problems?
* (4)The world is dynamic,knowledge is limited,but an AI agent must always begin with what it already knows.How then can an AI agent ever address a new problem?
* (5)Problem solving,reasoning,and learning are complex enough,but explanation and justification add to the complexity.How then can we get an AI agent to ever explain or justify it's decisions?

##  Characteristics of AI Problems

* (1)In many AI problems, data arrives incrementally not all the data comes right at the beginning.
* (2)Problems often have a recurring pattern,the same kinds of problems occur again and again.
* (3)Problems occur at many different levels of abstraction.
* (4)Many interesting AI problems are computationally intractable.
* (5)The world is dynamic,it's constantly changing but knowledge of the world is relative to static.
* (6)The world is open ended but knowledge of the world is relatively limited.

## AI as the technique of **uncertainty**

> AI = What to do when you don't know **what** to do?

* Reason for uncertainty

**Sensor limits**

**Adversaries**

**Stochastic environments**

**Laziness**

**Ignorance**(plain ignorance)

## What is AI base on knowledge

* Learning

> Learning too is a fundamental process of knowledge based AI

* Memory
* Reasoning

> We learn,so that we can reason.The result of reasoning often in additional learning.Once we learn,we can store it in memory.

* thinking
* acting
* optimally
* like humans

## Bayes rule

> Bayes Rule is one of the foundational elements of artificial intelligence and a critical concept of machine learning as well.

* Probability
* Statistics

![P(A|B)](http://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/546464-e17b611e50b053cb.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

> P of A given B,where B is the evidence and is variable we care about,is P of B given A times P of A over P of B.
